Tested on macOS 10.14.6



## Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/QiangZiBro/ScienceCalculator
cd ScienceCalculator
conda create --name=ScienceCalculator python=3.7
pip install -r requirements.txt

python main.py #run
```



## Limitationâ€‹

- Can't compute nested expression, e.g., sin(sin(1)). I am thinking about implementing  it by hand.
